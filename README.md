## Project Description ##

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

**You will be required to submit:**

- a tidy data set.
- a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis.
- a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
- You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This file explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

**Content of this repository:**

- CodeBook.md: describes the variables, the data, and transformations performed to clean up the data.
- README.md
- README.html
- run_analysis.R: Description of this script below.

**This script does the following:**

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
