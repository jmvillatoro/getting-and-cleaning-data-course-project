## Project Description ##

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

You will be required to submit:


- a tidy data set.
- a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis.
- a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
- You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This file explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
